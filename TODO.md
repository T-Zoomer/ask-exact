# TODO

* I would like to expose all the apis of https://start.exactonline.nl/docs/HlpRestAPIResources.aspx?SourceAction=10 generally in my django app, behind de /api/ url. ONLY THE GET APIS REACHABLE BY GET REQUEST. 
* thats useful for fiddling around with the api's manually and seeing what sort of results i get. 

* After that its time to build the chat interface.
